# MidiJunction

So you're in a worship team, or another music group of some kind, and all you have is a digital piano 1),
with a few limited sounds - and you're aching to take the sound to the next level but with limited resources
and a limited budget.

If you have access to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) like Propellerheads Reason or similar (yes, that's the
one I have) and a MIDI cable from the piano to your laptop, this program allows you to set up a range of
instruments in the DAW, enable or disable them quickly, layer them together, and create a soundscape that
is vastly superior to whatever you could get out of the piano.

MIDI Junction is entirely geared for live performances - it has zero recording ability - but will get you
through a worship service without the use of dedicated hardware or expensive live performance software.

It has three main benefits over similar software: 1) it's free, 2) it's kinda pretty, and 3) it snaps neatly
to the top of your screen, leaving you with the rest of the screen to work with your DAW if you need to.

Depends on Tobias Erichsens virtualMIDI driver, which you will need to download for free from
<http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html>

Download the program from the "Releases" tab.

Check out the Wiki tab for some simple documentation.

Bug reports or improvement suggestions are welcome :)
